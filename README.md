# Fake_News_Detection

This project was created to warn people of being duped by numerous false news stories on social media. To determine whether the news was fake or real, we had employed built-in Python libraries and machine learning algorithms. For this project, we employed a supervised dataset with a set of labels designating which news is real or fake. The module was created using some front-end skills, such as HTML5 and CSS3, and for the back-end, Python and the Flask Framework were utilised.
